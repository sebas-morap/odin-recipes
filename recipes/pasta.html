  <h1>Pasta</h1>
  <img src="./pasta.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pasta, a staple of Italian cuisine that has conquered hearts worldwide, is made primarily from durum wheat flour
    combined with water or eggs. This versatile food comes in hundreds of shapes and sizes, from long strands like
    spaghetti
    and fettuccine to short forms like penne and farfalle, each designed to hold sauces in unique ways. Fresh pasta,
    often
    made with eggs, has a tender, delicate texture, while dried pasta offers a firmer bite and longer shelf life.
    The history of pasta dates back thousands of years, with some historians believing it originated in China before
    making
    its way to Italy through trade routes. By the 14th century, pasta had become deeply embedded in Italian culture,
    with
    different regions developing their own signature dishes and sauce pairings. Today, pasta is celebrated not only for
    its
    delicious taste and texture but also for its affordability, ease of preparation, and ability to serve as a canvas
    for
    countless culinary creations, from simple garlic and olive oil combinations to rich meat-based rag√πs.</p>

  <h1>Lasagna</h1>
  <img src="./lasagna.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna, a beloved Italian dish that has become a global comfort food favorite, consists of layers of wide pasta
    sheets
    alternating with rich sauces, cheese, and various fillings. This hearty dish originated in the Emilia-Romagna region
    of
    Italy, particularly in the city of Bologna, where it was traditionally made with ragù (meat sauce), béchamel sauce,
    and
    Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. The pasta sheets themselves, when made fresh, are crafted from flour, eggs, and
    sometimes a
    pinch of salt, creating a tender yet sturdy foundation for the multiple layers.
    The beauty of lasagna lies in its versatility and the way its flavors meld together during baking. As the dish
    bakes,
    the pasta layers absorb the sauces while the cheese melts and creates a golden-brown crust on top. While traditional
    Italian lasagna follows specific regional recipes, modern variations have emerged worldwide, incorporating different
    ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, seafood, or even making vegetarian versions with roasted vegetables and
    alternative
    cheese combinations. The dish typically needs to rest for about 15 minutes after baking, allowing it to set properly
    and
    making it easier to cut into neat portions.</p>

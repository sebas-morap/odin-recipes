  <h1>Pizza</h1>
  <img src="./pizza.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pizza, one of the world's most beloved dishes, originated in Naples, Italy, where it began as a simple flatbread
    topped
    with tomatoes, cheese, and various local ingredients. The most famous variant, the Pizza Margherita, was created in
    1889
    to honor Queen Margherita of Italy, featuring the colors of the Italian flag with red tomatoes, white mozzarella,
    and
    green basil. The foundation of any great pizza lies in its dough, which requires a careful balance of flour, water,
    yeast, and time to develop the perfect texture and flavor.
    The art of pizza-making has evolved significantly over the centuries, spreading from Italy to become a global
    phenomenon
    with countless regional variations. The magic happens when the pizza is baked at high temperatures, ideally in a
    wood-fired oven reaching 800-900°F (427-482°C), though home ovens can also produce excellent results. During baking,
    the
    dough becomes crispy on the outside while remaining chewy inside, the cheese melts and potentially browns, and all
    the
    toppings meld together to create a harmonious blend of flavors and textures that has captivated food lovers
    worldwide.</p>
